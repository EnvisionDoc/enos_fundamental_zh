# Accessing EnOS™

All functions of the EnOS™ Cloud are exposed as service APIs. Some of the functions are provided in the EnOS™ Console for you to access through a user-friendly graphical interface.

## EnOS™ APIs

EnOS™ provides APIs for developers to add, delete, modify, and retrieve resources such as users, assets, and applications, to facilitate development of applications. EnOS™ adopts a variety of authentication and authorization techniques to ensure secure access to the APIs.

To access the EnOS™ APIs, you'll need to register the application that will invoke the APIs on EnOS™. The application can then access the APIs by presenting its application key and secret to be authenticated and authorized. For more information, see [Getting started with EnOS™ APIs](https://docs.envisioniot.com/docs/app-development/en/latest/EnOS™_apis/getting_started_EnOS™_apis.html) in the *Application Development* manual.

## EnOS™ Console

EnOS™ Console is a web-based graphic interface for you to interact with resources in the EnOS™. The following figure shows a configuration interface in the EnOS™ Console.

The user interface is mainly comprised of 3 parts:

- Banner: Where you can click ![Menu](media/menu.png) to show or hide the navigation tree.
- Navigation tree: Where you can access the entries to all functions of EnOS™ cloud. You can also customize your view of navigation tree by adding your most frequently used functions into favorites for quick access.
- Configuration panel: Where you perform all configuration tasks around your data and resources on EnOS™ cloud.
